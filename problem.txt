Face-Based Photo Search & Management
Managing and organizing large volumes of photos is a critical task for professional
photographers, yet the process is often inefficient and time-consuming. When clients request
photos featuring a particular person, photographers must manually sift through thousands of
images spread across local folders and cloud platforms like Google Drive. This manual effort
not only slows down workflows but also increases the chances of missing important photos,
ultimately affecting client satisfaction.
Your challenge is to design a unified digital platform that simplifies face-based image
search and management. The platform should allow users to select a photo, detect faces
within it, and automatically retrieve all other images containing the same face. In cases where
multiple faces are present in a single photo, the system must enable users to select the desired
face to perform the search. Additionally, the solution should support essential file
management features such as selection, copy, and cut, empowering users to curate and
organize results effortlessly.
The solution must work seamlessly across both local storage and Google Drive, providing
photographers with a single, user-friendly platform for managing and retrieving images. By
solving this problem, participants will create an intelligent and scalable solution that
transforms the way photographers handle large photo collections, saving time and delivering
more efficient, professional services to clients.
