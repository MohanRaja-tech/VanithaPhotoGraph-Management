    User selects a reference photo for face search.

    Detect faces in the selected image using a face detection model (e.g., Haar Cascade, MTCNN, Dlib, or FaceNet-based detection).

    Display all detected faces, allowing user to choose the target face for search.

    Scan specified local folders recursively to index all image files (JPEG, PNG, etc.).

    For each image, detect faces and extract facial embeddings/features for accurate matching.

    Compare chosen reference face's features against features from all other images:

        Identify images containing the same face using similarity thresholds.

    Present the search results in a preview gallery with selection options.

    Enable users to perform file management actions (select, copy, cut/move) directly from the results.

    Provide user interface for adding/removing folders from the local search scope.

    Support multi-threaded or batched processing to optimize performance for large folder structures.

    Persist face feature database locally to avoid redundant computation for future searches.

    Integrate basic error handling (unsupported formats, unreadable files, duplicate detection).
